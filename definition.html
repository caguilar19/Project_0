						The answer isn't simple. One can define a taco by including three basic components:
						<p></p>
						<ul>
							<li>A tortilla, used as the vessel for the rest of the components</li>
							<li>A filling, usually some type of meat possibly accompanied by vegetables or herbs</li>
							<li>A sauce</li>
						</ul>
						but this is oversimplifying the beautiful complexity of 
						the dish. The truth is, we can't give an exact definition
						to a taco, and that's not a bad thing. The idea of using
						a tortilla as a vessel for food was around before the
						term existed and it's evolved since the term was first
						used. The food is dynamic beyond any definition. If we 
						had stuck to a pure definition, 'taco al pastor' might 
						never have been referred to as a taco, for it didn't 
						line up with the miners' original dish.

						The one thing that truly characterizes a taco is the
						simple, elegant, magical tortilla. The tortilla is the
						canvas for the taco, which is part of what makes a 
						taco so special. A chef making a taco is an artist; they
						take a tortilla and apply their own style to creating
						their own taco&#8212whether or not it would fall under the
						realm of 'traditional Mexican' has no effect on the 
						status of the dish as a taco. By being such a simple 
						dish, it opens up the doors to be truly creative, which
						has given rise to incredible gastronomical blending.
						From the Korean tacos at Kogi to the Lebanese influenced
						tacos al pastor in Mexico, tacos are truly a dish that
						transcends one culture. It's an expression, like chef
						Enrique Olvera said, whose
						versatility is what makes it so appealing. It's a work
						of art stemming from a simple base: a tortilla.
