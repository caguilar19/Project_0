	This is a website dedicated to the appreciation of one of the most simple 
and delicious dishes in the world: the taco. The site has four pages: a home 
page, a page describing the history of the taco, a page defining–or refusing to
define–the taco, and a page with some recommended Mexican restaurants in New York 
City and Mexico City. 
	All of the styling outside of Bootstrap 4 is in style.scss which compiles into
style.css.
	The site's main page features a title that reveals the IPA pronunciation of
'taco' when hovering over it. The columns of text on the home page switch from 
columns to rows if the viewport is at most as wide as an iPhone X. 
	The sources which I used while making the site are included in sources.txt.
