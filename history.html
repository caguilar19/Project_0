							Although its true origins are unknown, there are theories
							on where how taco was invented. Jeffrey M. Pilcher, who 
							has studied tortillas for approximately twenty years, 
							theorizes that tacos originally came from Mexican silver 
							miners during the 18th century. Although the tortilla 
							had been a major part of the mesoamerican diet before
							this, Pilcher claims that it wasn't refered to as a taco
							until the miners. He argues that the word 'taco' comes
							from the name for the charges used by the miners. As the
							dish evolved&#8212especially under industrialization when
							migrating women brought their cooking skills to Mexico
							City&#8212the taco came to represent a dish not reserved
							for the wealthy.

						One of the big developments in the history of the taco
						was the birth of 'el taco al pastor' which began with
						the arrival of Middle Eastern immigrants&#8212especially 
						Lebanese. The Lebanese immigrants began to sell 
						'tacos arabes,' consisting of shawarma served in a bread
						similar to a pita. Eventually, this taco evolved into
						the famous 'al pastor' as the lamb originally used was
						replaced by marinaded pork and the tacos were served on 
						tortillas with pineapple. According to Pilcher, this taco 
						became popular during the 1960s as the children of the
						original Lebanese immigrants began selling the 
						transformed version of the original dish&#8212which can
						still be found around Mexico.
